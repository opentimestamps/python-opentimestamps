    Commitment has been recorded in a remote calendar for future attestation,
    and we have a URI to find a more complete timestamp in the future.

    Nothing other than the URI is recorded, nor is there provision made to add
    extra metadata (other than the URI) in future upgrades. The rational here
    is that remote calendars promise to keep commitments indefinitely, so from
    the moment they are created it should be possible to find the commitment in
    the calendar. Thus if you're not satisfied with the local verifiability of
    a timestamp, the correct thing to do is just ask the remote calendar if
    additional attestations are available and/or when they'll be available.

    While we could additional metadata like what types of attestations the
    remote calendar expects to be able to provide in the future, that metadata
    can easily change in the future too. Given that we don't expect timestamps
    to normally have more than a small number of remote calendar attestations,
    it'd be better to have verifiers get the most recent status of such
    information (possibly with appropriate negative response caching).

    The commitment digest will be the merkleroot of the blockheader.

    The block height is recorded so that looking up the correct block header in
    an external block header database doesn't require every header to be stored
    locally (33MB and counting). (remember that a memory-constrained local
    client can save an MMR that commits to all blocks, and use an external service to fill
    in pruned details).

    Otherwise no additional redundant data about the block header is recorded.
    This is very intentional: since the attestation contains (nearly) the
    absolute bare minimum amount of data, we encourage implementations to do
    the correct thing and get the block header from a by-height index, check
    that the merkleroots match, and then calculate the time from the header
    information. Providing more data would encourage implementations to cheat.

    Remember that the only thing that would invalidate the block height is a
    reorg, but in the event of a reorg the merkleroot will be invalid anyway,
    so there's no point to recording data in the attestation like the header
    itself. At best that would just give us extra confirmation that a reorg
    made the attestation invalid; reorgs deep enough to invalidate timestamps are
    exceptionally rare events anyway, so better to just tell the user the timestamp
    can't be verified rather than add almost-never tested code to handle that case
    more gracefully.
